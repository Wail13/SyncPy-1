SyncPy Python Library
=============================

The SyncPy Python Library is an ongoing open-source project conceived and developed at
the Institut des Systèmes Intelligentes et Robotique (ISIR) at the Université
Pierre et Marie Curie (UPMC), Paris 6, France.

SyncPy library is currently under development in the framework of the 
SMART Labex Project (http://www.smart-labex.fr)


Motivation
------------------------

SyncPy is a novel open-source analytic library for investigating 
synchrony in a fast and exhaustive way. It stems from work and 
discussions among researchers on synchrony in different domains 
as engineering, computer science and psychology. 

SyncPy is mainly aimed at helping researchers to explore, try and compare in an easy 
way and with a single tool synchrony methods starting from signals. 
Signals are synthetic or experimental time series organized as Python 
pandas DataFrames.

The library has been conceived to investigate synchrony in human-human/
human machine interaction, however, although it focuses on interpersonal 
synchrony, all the methods are exploitable in other contexts.

Architecture
------------------------

SyncPy includes three main components:
- Utils package 
- Graphical interface
- Synchrony methods package


The utils package contains functionals of general utility directly used 
by the synchrony methods or to preprocess the input signals.

The graphical interface is a pyQT application conceived to assist users 
to choose and try several methods. More specifically, it allows users to:
1) load time series from files
2) visualize these time series
3) choose a consistent method according to the data set
4) compute the selected method and
5) visualize and/or save the result in a file (.csv format, .png format).

The synchrony methods package contains the methods to compute synchrony. 
The methods are organized following the structure described in the paper: 
"SyncPy - A unified analytic library for synchrony" (see References).
